<summary><h3>Accessibility:</h3></summary>
<p>
This project must support WCAG accessibility level AA <em>(edit this according to the requirements of your project)</em>. To ensure this standard is met, remember to:

- Perform automated checks using a tool such as Wave or SiteImprove.
- Test keyboard navigation: are all parts of the UI navigable using only the keyboard? Is the tab order logical? Can popups, menus etc be dismissed with the escape key?
- Test responsiveness, scaling and text reflow.
- Make sure no accessibility issues exist on either desktop or mobile views.
- If you have time, test with a screen reader such as VoiceOver (macOS), NVDA (Windows), or Orca (Linux).

Use the [Accessibility Testing Cheat Sheet](https://intra.wunder.io/info/accessibility-group/accessibility-testing-cheat-sheet) for information on how to run these tests.
